# ttk_demos

themed tkinter (ttk) demonstration programs for python3.

A series of programs that introduce a ttk widget and then expand on the way the widget may be used or modified by changing its theme. The objective of these programs is to aid with learning python programming with the ttk GUI.

Programs series:

program_00 Template

program_01 Labels and Buttons

program_02 Frame with labels and buttons

program_03 Radiobutton.

Notes:

Only python3 is supported. The programs feature the use of the ttk widget set. This is comprised of 17 widgets and they may all be modified using the theme / style feature. There are some tkinter widgets that are frequently used in GUI applications that are not part of the ttk widget set. These tkinter widgets may be used, but they are not supported by the theme / style feature.

All programs are written implementing a similar python layout. See program_00a.py as a simple GUI. Program_00b.py contains a template for adding another class in order to add new features to the GUI.
